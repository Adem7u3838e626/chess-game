# Chess Game: An Introduction

## What is Chess?
Chess is a two-player strategy board game that is played on an 8x8 grid. Each player controls 16 pieces:
- 1 King
- 1 Queen
- 2 Rooks
- 2 Knights
- 2 Bishops
- 8 Pawns

**Objective**: The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent's King, meaning the King is in a position where it cannot escape capture.

## Chess Board Setup

The chessboard consists of **64 squares** of alternating colors (light and dark). Each player starts with the pieces arranged as follows:
- **Back row**: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook (from left to right).
- **Front row**: All pawns are placed on the second (White) or seventh (Black) rank.

**Important**: The Queen always starts on the color of her piece (White Queen on white square, Black Queen on black square).

## How Pieces Move

- **King**: Moves one square in any direction (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
- **Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any direction.
- **Rook**: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
- **Bishop**: Moves diagonally any number of squares.
- **Knight**: Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or vice versa. Can jump over other pieces.
- **Pawn**: Moves forward one square but captures diagonally. On its first move, it can move two squares.

## Basic Chess Rules

- **Check**: The King is in danger of being captured. The player must move the King out of check or block the attack.
- **Checkmate**: The King is in check and has no legal moves to escape. This ends the game.
- **Castling**: A special move involving the King and a Rook. The King moves two squares towards the Rook, and the Rook moves to the square next to the King. This move can only be made if neither piece has moved before, and there are no pieces between them.
- **En Passant**: A special pawn capture that can happen when a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and lands next to an opponent's pawn.
- **Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opponent's back row, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a King), typically a Queen.
